						<p>These figures are scaled by the per population rate for Pākehā, which allows it to be compared with with per population rates for Māori and Pacific people. The Pākehā rate is always 1.00 after scaling, so as you select different tactical options you'll see that bar never changes height.</p>

				<h3>2014 Data</h3>

				<p>Values for 2014 have been calculated from statistics in this report: <a href="http://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/annual-tactical-options-research-report-3.pdf" target="_blank">NZ Police Annual Tactical Options Research Report #3</a></p>

				<p>The "per 100,000 population" values from 2014 have been halved to make them directly comparable with data from the 6 month period of July-December 2016.</p>

				<h3>July-December 2016 Data</h3>

				<p>Values for July-December 2016 have been calculated from raw data released by NZ Police in response to a request made by Emmy Rākete under the Official Information Act: <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/request/5039-tactical-options-research-report#incoming-17868" target="_blank">Tactical options research report</a></p>

				<p>The raw data has been released because the time period for submitting Tactical Options Reports for this period has finished. However, 11% of these reported events have not completed NZ Police's two-stage review process.</p>

				<p>The raw data released for July-December has had some information withheld for privacy reasons, such as the exact date of the event and the name of the reporter, though none of this information is relevant to the data presented in this visualisation. Also, the raw data has not been processed by NZ Police to fix mistakes that may be found such as errors in data entry. NZ Police have requested that the data be presented alongside a proviso that "<i>this information is raw data which has not been checked and which is therefore incomplete and unreliable</i>".</p>

				<p>The "per 100,000 population" values for 2016 have been calculated using numbers from the 2013 census provided by Stats NZ: <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/cultural-diversity.aspx" target="_blank">2013 Census QuickStats about national highlights</a></p>

				<h3>Firearms and tasers</h3>

				<p>Firearm and taser events include both "shows" and discharges.</p>

				<h3>Sponge rounds and communication</h3>

				<p>Values for the "sponge rounds" and "communication" tactical options are not shown as they are not available for both time periods. Sponge rounds underwent a trial in 2014, and data on "communication" as a tactical option is not available for 2014.</p>
